I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Asst. Prof. Sukree Sinthupinyo, Ph.D., and Pitchaya Sitthi-amorn, Ph.D., for their exceptional guidance and dedication in the **2190152 Advanced Computer Programming Laboratory** course.

## How to Use This Repository

While the answer keys are available here, it's important to approach them with the intention of learning and enhancing your programming skills. Here's how you can make the best use of this repository:

1. **Understand the Concepts:** Before looking at the answer keys, make sure you have attempted the assignments on your own. Strive to understand the underlying concepts and logic behind the problems.

2. **Compare Solutions:** After attempting the assignments, you can refer to the answer keys to compare your solutions with the provided ones. Pay attention to differences in approach, coding style, and techniques used.

3. **Learn and Apply:** Use the answer keys as a learning resource. Understand why certain decisions were made in the code and how they contribute to the overall solution. Apply this understanding to your own coding practices.

4. **Avoid Copying:** As mentioned earlier, avoid direct copying of the provided code. Plagiarism not only hampers your learning but also goes against the principles of academic integrity.
